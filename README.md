### Collection of personal dotfiles

Outline:
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - Text editor
* [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) - Terminal
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - Terminal Multiplexing
* [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - Shell
* [Starship](https://starship.rs/) - Shell prompt
* [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - Key-remapping


Notes:
* Purely for hobby/experimenting
* Slowly build up neovim config to have features similar to an IDE (with help from [lsp](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and [treesitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/))
* Attempt to use neovim for full-timeÂ golang dev work (already started!)
* Minimal features for fast(_pro_) text editing
* Use neovim for everything imaginable
* Continous work-in-progress
* [Screenshots](screenshots/)


TODOs:
* Debugging from within neovim
